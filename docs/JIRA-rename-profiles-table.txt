Summary: Rename profiles table to user_profiles for better naming convention

Description:
Rename the existing profiles table to user_profiles to follow more descriptive naming conventions and improve code clarity. The current table name "profiles" is too generic and could conflict with other profile-related entities in the application.

Acceptance Criteria:
• Create database migration to rename profiles table to user_profiles
• Update existing migration file that adds name columns to reference new table name
• Update database trigger function handle_new_user() to reference user_profiles table
• Ensure all INSERT and UPDATE operations target the renamed table
• Verify that existing data remains intact during the rename operation
• Test that user signup process continues to work with new table name
• Confirm that profile creation triggers execute successfully

Technical Details:
The migration will rename the table using ALTER TABLE profiles RENAME TO user_profiles and update the trigger function to reference the new table name. The existing migration file 20250107000001_add_name_columns_to_profiles.sql will be updated to reference user_profiles instead of profiles.

Definition of Done:
• Migration file created and tested successfully
• Existing migration updated to use new table name
• Database trigger function updated and working
• User signup process creates records in user_profiles table
• No data loss or corruption during table rename
• All tests pass with new table structure
