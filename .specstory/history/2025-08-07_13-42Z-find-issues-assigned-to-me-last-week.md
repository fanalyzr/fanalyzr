_**Assistant**_

I'll help you search for Jira issues assigned to you in the last 7 days. First, let me get your user information and then search for the issues.


---

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: atlassian - atlassianUserInfo: Get current user info from Atlassian

*Parameters*:
  * random_string: get_user_info

*Result*:

</details>

Now let me get the accessible Atlassian resources to find the cloud ID:


---

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: atlassian - getAccessibleAtlassianResources: Get cloudid to construct API calls to Atlassian REST APIs

*Result*:

</details>

Perfect! Now I'll search for Jira issues assigned to you in the last 7 days using JQL:


---

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: atlassian - searchJiraIssuesUsingJql: Search Jira issues using Jira Query Language (JQL).

*Parameters*:
  * cloudId: d0b441f5-70ba-49db-9dab-baf4bba39998
  * jql: assignee = "712020:6587c422-d293-4061-85dc-2c542c39091c" AND updated >= -7d ORDER BY updated DESC
  * maxResults: 50
  * fields: summary,status,issuetype,priority,created,updated,project

*Result*:
{"issues":[],"isLast":true}
</details>

---

It looks like there are no Jira issues assigned to you that have been updated in the last 7 days. Let me try a broader search to see if there are any issues assigned to you at all:

I can see there's only one project available called "MVP". Since there's no specific "MCP" project, I'll create the issues in the MVP project. Let me start by creating the Epic first, then the individual stories and tasks.

Let me create the Epic first:

*Called tool*: atlassian - createJiraIssue: Create a new Jira issue in a given project with a given issue type.

*Parameters*:
  * cloudId: d0b441f5-70ba-49db-9dab-baf4bba39998
  * projectKey: MVP
  * issueTypeName: Story
  * summary: Update Dashboard Welcome Message to Display First Name Only
  * description: ## User Story
As a user, I want the dashboard welcome message to show only my first name instead of my full name, so that the greeting feels more personal and concise.

## Current Behavior
- Dashboard shows "Welcome back 👋 Josh Yarber" (full display name)
- Analytics view shows generic "Hi, Welcome back 👋" without personalization

## Desired Behavior
- Dashboard shows "Welcome back 👋 Josh" (first name only)
- Analytics view shows "Hi, Welcome back 👋 Josh" (personalized with first name)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] App overview dashboard displays "Welcome back 👋 [FirstName]" instead of full display name
- [ ] Analytics overview dashboard displays "Hi, Welcome back 👋 [FirstName]" instead of generic message
- [ ] First name is extracted from authenticated user's displayName field
- [ ] Solution handles edge cases (empty names, single names, extra whitespace)
- [ ] Welcome messages use real authenticated user data via useAuthContext
- [ ] No hard-coded names or demo data remain

## Technical Details
Files to modify:
- `src/sections/overview/app/view/overview-app-view.tsx`
- `src/sections/overview/analytics/view/overview-analytics-view.tsx`

Key Changes:
1. Added getFirstName() helper function to both components
2. Replaced user?.displayName with firstName variable
3. Updated both app and analytics overview welcome messages
4. Maintained existing authentication integration

## Definition of Done
- Dashboard welcome message shows first name only (e.g., "Josh" instead of "Josh Yarber")
- Analytics welcome message is personalized with first name
- Helper function handles various name formats correctly
- No performance impact on dashboard load times
- Works consistently across different user accounts
- Code follows existing component patterns and conventions

## Test Cases

**Test Scenario 1: Standard Full Name**
- Given: User displayName is "John Smith"
- When: User views dashboard
- Then: Welcome message shows "Welcome back 👋 John"

**Test Scenario 2: Single Name**
- Given: User displayName is "Madonna"
- When: User views dashboard
- Then: Welcome message shows "Welcome back 👋 Madonna"

**Test Scenario 3: Empty/Missing Name**
- Given: User displayName is empty or null
- When: User views dashboard
- Then: Welcome message shows "Welcome back 👋" (graceful fallback)

**Test Scenario 4: Name with Extra Whitespace**
- Given: User displayName is "  Alice  Johnson  "
- When: User views dashboard
- Then: Welcome message shows "Welcome back 👋 Alice" (trimmed properly)
