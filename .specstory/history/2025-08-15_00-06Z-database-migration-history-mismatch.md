# Database migration history mismatch (2025-08-15 00:06Z)

_**User**_

@dev.md The remote database's migration history does not match local files in supabase\migrations directory.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating migration issues**

There seems to be a problem where the remote migrations don’t match the local ones. I think the first step is to fetch the remote migration list using `supabase migration list -i remote`. However, I remember that `supabase migration list` shows the status of local migrations in relation to the local database. I also need to consider using `--db-url` or `--project-ref`. It seems running commands may require user approval, so I’ll propose a command instead of executing automatically.
**Inspecting migration files**

I'm starting from the workspace root at `C:\Apps\fanalyzr`, and I think I should do a discovery pass to read the necessary files. I see that the project contains a lot of migration files in `supabase/migrations`. It might be a good idea to check the `supabase/config.toml` file for the remote project reference. Also, I want to look at `package.json` to ensure the Supabase CLI is set up. While I can't assume the CLI is installed, I can still propose some commands. My plan includes reading the `supabase/config.toml` and listing the migration files.
**Managing database migrations**

I’m considering using `db pull` to import the database schema into `supabase/schema.sql` and then generating a diff migration for local changes. I also want to align migrations with `supabase migration list --schema`, but it’s a bit unclear. There's a known error when running `supabase db reset` due to mismatches. A typical fix might be to link the project and unlink it afterward, or I could use `supabase db remote reset`. There might also be a repair command for migrations, similar to Prisma's, but I need to check the documentation to ensure accuracy.
**Clarifying migration options**

I want to provide clear options for managing the database. If the local version is the source of truth and needs to overwrite the remote, I should suggest running `supabase db remote reset --project-ref <ref>`. I think there’s also `supabase db reset --linked` with a `--remote` flag. I’ll need to verify these commands using the web search tool. I'll search for terms related to mismatched migrations and the remote reset command, while also checking the `supabase/config.toml` and listing migrations. I plan to run four tool calls in parallel!</details></think>

---

I'll inspect the Supabase config and migrations locally, and fetch the precise Supabase CLI commands to resolve migration history mismatches. Proceeding to read the config, list migrations, and search the Supabase docs for the correct commands.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating remote migration fixes**

When fixing remote migration issues, if the remote has extra migrations not locally present, I can use the command "supabase migration repair <version> --status reverted" to update the remote history. However, this carries risks. Another command "supabase migration create --from-remote" doesn’t exist; instead, “db pull” or “db diff” are available options. Using "db pull" creates a single migration file for syncing, but doesn’t necessarily match earlier migrations. To push local changes, I'd use "supabase db push" or "db reset --remote." So, reconciling remote to local might require reverting remote migration histories and then pushing updates.
**Clarifying schema reversion process**

I realize that I can't revert the schema with just the 'repair' command. To remove changes from the remote schema, I must write down migrations to revert and push them or reset the entire remote database, which is risky. It seems like there might be a mismatch in the history tables from previously pulled remote schema migration files. The solution is to run "supabase migration list --status all" and "supabase migration repair <version>." I should check if the Supabase CLI is installed, suggesting installation options if necessary.
**Assessing Supabase CLI options**

I can suggest using "npx -y supabase@latest migration list --project-ref ..." to avoid prompts and ensure it installs correctly without interaction. I need to run this command in the specified directory, but I’ll also require the access token for remote access. The usual "supabase login" is interactive, so I might need to pass the "SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN" as an environment variable. However, without this token, the migration list command may fail. I do have the option to connect using a DB URL directly, but the remote DB URL is hidden, complicating things. It seems like I might be running into some roadblocks here.
**Providing instructions for migration commands**

I can guide the user with steps and propose commands, leaving placeholders for tokens. Even though the guidelines say to keep going unless halted, it seems we are blocked without the 'SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN.' I’ll ask the user to provide this token or suggest that they run the commands themselves. I can still perform a local environment check by running "npx supabase@latest migration list," which displays local migrations without requiring authentication. However, listing remote migrations does need login. I think it’s best to provide clear, minimal steps while adhering to the status update requirements.
**Revisiting status updates and command proposals**

In my previous message, I seemed to have missed a status update regarding tool calls. However, I did mention inspecting the config and listing migrations, which counts as a status update. Now, I need to propose terminal commands for local migrations or a login attempt, but since we can’t log in, I’ll suggest a plan for the user to approve. 

The plan includes commands to show local migrations, link the project if necessary, and view remote versus local lists. I’ll confirm the exact CLI flags and refine my proposals accordingly.</details></think>

---

I'll quickly confirm the exact Supabase CLI commands for listing and repairing migrations, then propose non-interactive PowerShell commands you can run.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Proposing Supabase Commands**

I need to navigate using Supabase CLI v2, which uses 'supabase link' for linking and requires a project_id in the local config. Remote operations necessitate an access token set by 'supabase login.' If the CLI isn't installed in our workspace, command execution might fail. I'll propose a command for the user to run, using placeholders for the token where necessary. 

I can suggest checking the migration list and, if there are remote migrations not local, using 'supabase db pull' to sync changes safely.
**Clarifying Supabase Operations**

I need to clarify that 'supabase db pull' pulls the current remote schema into 'supabase/schema.sql,' while migrations are handled differently. There's also 'db diff' for generating migration files and a list of existing migrations. In Supabase CLI v2, 'db pull' creates a migration file named '..._remote_schema.sql' that captures the entire schema.

To resolve mismatches, if there are local migrations not present in remote, I should suggest using 'supabase db push' or 'supabase migration up' if DDL changes are disallowed.
**Exploring Migration Commands**

When dealing with remote operations, using 'migration up --db-url <remote_url>' is a common approach. However, typically you’d initiate with 'supabase link' followed by 'supabase db push' and maybe 'supabase secrets set.' The recommended method in Supabase involves managing migrations through 'supabase db reset' for local and 'supabase db diff' for remote migrations, followed by 'supabase db push.'

To ensure proper alignment of history without altering the schema, I can suggest using 'supabase migration list' and 'supabase migration repair <version> --status applied/reverted.' After that, running 'supabase db pull' will backfill remote changes.
**Proposing Migration Commands**

I'm suggesting that we use 'supabase migration list' and 'supabase migration repair' with a placeholder for <VERSION>. It could also be helpful to include a command like 'supabase db reset' to fix the local environment and to run 'supabase migration list | cat' to avoid using a pager. 

We should clarify the user's desired source of truth, whether they prefer remote or local. By default, I’m treating remote as the truth, so we’ll repair mismatches and pull the remote schema to a new migration file. Let's keep this concise and clear!
**Fixing Migration Mismatch**

To avoid data loss, we should treat the remote as the source of truth, proposing two options: "Option A: Make remote the source of truth" or "Option B: Apply local to remote." 

I need to provide commands with placeholders indicating version timestamps and utilize the run_terminal_cmd tool for user proposed commands. Here’s a structured approach:

- **Step 0:** Ensure CLI version: 
  ```powershell
  supabase --version
  ```

- **Step 1:** Log in or set token:
  ```powershell
  supabase login
  ```

- **Step 2:** List migrations:
  ```powershell
  supabase migration list --project-ref kqablakxhquebemxhdfn | cat
  ```

By making the remote the source, we can generate a baseline migration, pulling the current remote schema and aligning histories.
**Providing Non-Interactive Supabase Commands**

To maintain a non-interactive setup, I’m suggesting we use an environment variable for the access token to avoid the interactive 'supabase login' command. I can show how to set it with:

```powershell
$env:SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN='YOUR_PAT'
```

Then, I'll propose the following commands for the user to run:

```powershell
cd C:\Apps\fanalyzr
supabase --version | cat
supabase link --project-ref kqablakxhquebemxhdfn --debug | cat
supabase migration list | cat
```

For options:

**Option A**:
```powershell
supabase db pull --linked | cat
$ver=(Get-ChildItem supabase\migrations\*_remote_schema.sql | Sort-Object LastWriteTime | Select-Object -Last 1).BaseName.Split('_')[0]; supabase migration repair $ver --status applied
supabase db reset --debug | cat
```

**Option B**:
```powershell
supabase db push --include-all --debug | cat
supabase migration list
```

I'll ensure to keep explanations concise and summarize the status of the operations.</details></think>

### Fix Supabase migration history mismatch

Below are safe, copy‑paste PowerShell commands. Pick the source of truth first.

- Remote is source of truth (recommended if remote has live data)
- Local is source of truth (only if you intend to change remote to match local)

First, set up and inspect:

```powershell
cd C:\Apps\fanalyzr
supabase --version | cat

# Optional: non‑interactive auth (replace with your Supabase Personal Access Token)
# $env:SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN = '<YOUR_SUPABASE_PAT>'

# Ensure the project is linked (uses project_ref from supabase\config.toml)
supabase link --project-ref kqablakxhquebemxhdfn | cat

# See exactly what's mismatched
supabase migration list | cat
```

### Option A — Make remote the source of truth
```powershell
# Pull current remote schema into a local migration (creates *_remote_schema.sql)
supabase db pull | cat

# Mark the pulled migration as applied in remote history (no SQL is executed)
$ver = (Get-ChildItem supabase\migrations\*_remote_schema.sql | Sort-Object LastWriteTime | Select-Object -Last 1).BaseName.Split('_')[0]
supabase migration repair $ver --status applied | cat

# Reset local DB to ensure local matches migrations
supabase db reset | cat

# Verify clean state
supabase migration list | cat
```

### Option B — Make local the source of truth
```powershell
# Apply local migrations to the remote project
supabase db push | cat

# If any out-of-band remote entries still exist, mark them reverted (replace <VERSION>)
# supabase migration repair <VERSION> --status reverted | cat

# Verify clean state
supabase migration list | cat
```

Notes:
- Use the timestamp at the start of a migration filename as `<VERSION>` when repairing.
- `repair` only edits migration history; it does not run SQL. Use it only when schema already matches your intent.

If you want, tell me which option you prefer and I’ll run the exact commands for you. 

- Read `supabase/config.toml` and listed `supabase/migrations` to confirm project ref and available migrations.
- Provided precise, non‑interactive PowerShell commands for both directions.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating command options**

I want to avoid any interactive input and consider setting the SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN if necessary, but without the PAT, non-interactive linking won't work. If the CLI is linked through the config, commands can run using --project-ref. However, if not logged in, commands will fail. I could first try 'supabase migration list' with the project ref to check for mismatches before proceeding with 'supabase db pull.' But the user mentioned they want option A.
**Planning command execution**

I think we should proceed by pulling the schema and getting the latest created filename that ends with _remote_schema.sql. Then, I need to compute the version, run migration repair to mark it as applied, reset the local database, and verify. Since the commands depend on each other, I'll run them sequentially using functions.run_terminal_cmd. 

I’ll start by setting the working directory to 'C:\Apps\fanalyzr' with appropriate command separators for PowerShell. I'll be cautious about ensuring the environment persists as expected.
**Understanding command execution**

I realize we haven't used run_terminal_cmd before, and if we're in a new shell, I'll need to include 'cd' each time because the tool might open a new shell for every call. Generally, each call is independent, but the environment persists only if we're in the same shell. To be safe, I’ll start each command with 'cd'.

For the first command, I’ll navigate to the workspace and run 'supabase migration list | cat' for logging, then proceed to follow Option A and run 'supabase db pull | cat' to capture the new filename for versioning.
**Considering command execution limitations**

I realize that run_terminal_cmd might struggle to read filenames directly. Instead, I could use PowerShell to compute the version by getting the latest _remote_schema.sql file. After that, I’d call 'supabase migration repair' to mark the version as applied. However, the spec suggests the environment persists across calls only if it’s the same shell, and it’s unclear if we're using the same shell throughout. To be safe, I’ll combine both steps into a single command to set the version and perform the repair, ensuring the db pull completes first.
**Planning command execution sequence**

I plan to combine several commands into a single execution sequence. First, I'll change the directory and run the 'supabase db pull | cat' command, then compute the version with PowerShell to prepare for migration repair. Next, I’ll run 'supabase db reset | cat' and finally 'supabase migration list | cat'.

It’s crucial to ensure correct quoting and path separators. The newest schema file will be selected based on LastWriteTime. If the supabase CLI isn't installed, I’ll handle that failure appropriately. I’ll provide a status update before each command execution and proceed step by step.</details></think>

I’m going to pull the current remote schema to a local migration, mark that migration as applied in the remote history, reset the local DB from migrations, and verify the state.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Installing Supabase CLI**

I need to proceed since the Supabase CLI isn't in the system path, according to the dev workflow. Node.js 20 and Yarn are required. The CLI can be installed using npm or standalone options. For Windows, using npm is easiest with `npm i -g supabase`, but maybe they prefer Scoop or Chocolatey. I’ll consider asking for permission since we need to run commands non-interactively, and it seems we may need to link the Supabase project afterward.
**Running Supabase Commands**

I'm looking at how to execute tasks using the multi_tool_use.parallel wrapper. The plan is to install the Supabase CLI, run `supabase link`, and then pull, repair, reset, etc. Since these steps depend on each other, I need to ensure the CLI is installed first. I'll attempt to install it via `npm i -g supabase`. I'll check if Node is installed by running `npm -v` before proceeding. However, we still need an access token, which the user hasn’t provided, so I hope the database pull can work.
**Requesting Access Token**

I need to determine whether to ask the user for a Personal Access Token (PAT) or to use the `supabase.config` with a service role key since the CLI requires authentication for remote access. I could proceed with "Option A," which only requires `supabase db pull`, facilitated by a database connection. However, the CLI needs an access token to perform remote operations, so I should prompt for the `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and perhaps the database password as well. This will allow us to connect properly.
**Linking Remote Database**

When linking to a cloud service, the Supabase CLI needs to obtain remote database connection information using a Personal Access Token (PAT). After this, `supabase db pull` can be executed. However, we’re currently blocked due to the missing CLI and token. I’ll first install the CLI and then halt to ask the user for the PAT. I plan to run commands to verify Node installation and proceed with the Supabase CLI installation. I will prompt the user for the PAT for future linking.
**Preparing to Install CLI**

I need to provide anchor text for the user to create a Personal Access Token (PAT). I think using backticks around the link `https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens` is the best option for clarity. I'll give minimal instructions and remind the user to store the token in an environment variable. Once the token is received, we can continue with subsequent commands. Meanwhile, I should prepare to read the migrations directory and verify any remote schema mismatches. Now it's time to execute the install steps by checking Node and installing the CLI.</details></think>

---

I’m going to install the Supabase CLI globally and verify it’s available. Then I’ll pause to get your Supabase Personal Access Token so I can link the project non‑interactively and proceed with Option A.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Installing Supabase CLI and Linking**

I need to proceed with Option A, but it looks like the Supabase CLI isn’t installed. For Windows, it’s recommended to install it using Scoop, Chocolatey, or a downloadable binary. The official install method involves using PowerShell with a specific command. After installation, checking the version with `supabase --version` is next. For linking to the project, I’ll need the user’s PAT, but I might prompt for it as it seems necessary for authentication. Let's figure this out!
**Installing Supabase CLI and Checking Environment Variables**

I can start by asking the user to set the environment variable before proceeding, but I need to run the installation first. After installing, I’ll stop to ask for the PAT as originally planned. However, the instructions suggest I need to keep commands flowing in the same turn. Since the npm install attempt failed, I’ll run the official install script, check the version, and see if the `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set in the environment. If it’s not, I’ll prompt the user. Let's get started!
**Linking Supabase Project and Managing Tokens**

If a project reference exists, I can try running `supabase link --project-ref kqablakxhquebemxhdfn --debug`, possibly including a password option. The CLI requires an interactive login without a token, but if the token environment variable is set, I can log in non-interactively with `supabase login --token $env:SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`. I'll first read the token variable and attempt login if it exists. Then, I'll proceed with the Option A flow, resetting the local database using Docker. Let's implement this using PowerShell!
**Executing Supabase Commands Sequentially**

I need to run the commands in sequence, but I can only issue one `run_terminal_cmd` per step. However, I can create a single command line that includes multiple commands separated by `;`. The plan is as follows: 

First, I'll install the CLI. Then, I’ll check the version and look for the token in the environment variable. If it exists, I'll log in non-interactively; if not, I’ll send a message indicating that a token is needed. After that, I'll link the project and proceed with Option A to manage migrations and reset the database. Let’s get to it!
**Running Supabase Commands More Effectively**

I plan to run the commands while avoiding any unnecessary piping issues since PowerShell's `cat` is not suitable for this context. I'll execute the installation of the Supabase CLI, check its version, and handle the token for non-interactive login properly. It’s important to remind the user to set the `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` if it's not already done.

I’ll continue by linking the project and managing migrations without using `| cat` or unnecessary options. Finally, I'll include a non-confirmation flag for the database reset to streamline the process. Let's run these commands!</details></think>

---

I’m installing the Supabase CLI via the official Windows script, checking for an existing SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN, attempting non-interactive login if present, linking the project, then executing Option A steps (pull, repair, reset, verify). If a token isn’t set, I’ll stop after install and prompt you for it.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering Supabase installation options**

I'm trying to resolve how to set up the Supabase CLI as a remote source. Initially, I attempted to install it via npm, but that didn't work. I found that the recommended methods for Windows include using Scoop or Chocolatey, or downloading directly from GitHub. I checked the Supabase documentation, but my previous URL attempt failed. It might be safer to proceed with Scoop for installation, assuming the user has it installed. Alternatively, I could consider npm as a last option.
**Exploring Supabase installation methods**

The earlier error indicated that a global installation isn't supported, but a local one might work. I discovered that the Supabase npm package can download the binary post-installation. I can install it locally using `npm i -D supabase`, which adds it as a devDependency and places the binary in the `node_modules/.bin` folder. From there, I can run it with `npx supabase`. It seems easier and doesn't require admin rights! Next, I'll need the SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN set up.
**Clarifying Supabase linking and database pulling**

When using `supabase link --project-ref`, I can use a token. If it's not set, it prompts for a browser login, but I'd prefer to avoid interactive flows since the user might not be available. So, I'll need to ask for a personal access token or set an environment variable. I could try reading from `supabase/config.toml` for the project reference, but the Supabase CLI requires authentication for remote commands like `db pull`. By default, `supabase db pull` pulls from the local dev database unless I provide a `--db-url`.
**Linking and installing Supabase CLI**

For remote operations using the Supabase CLI, linking to a remote project is essential. Without this link, commands like `db pull` default to pulling from the local database. Thus, I need to request a personal access token (PAT) from the user. Since I can't link yet, I can install the local Supabase package first. So, the plan is to install Supabase as a devDependency and then pause to request the PAT for linking. I'll execute</details></think>

just put npx before supabase commands

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Proceeding with commands**

I need to proceed with Option A using npx supabase commands, since the user suggested adding "npx" before the commands. We can run them directly this way. On Windows PowerShell, piping to cat isn't actually necessary, as the Supabase output doesn't require a pager. I recall a previous error happened when trying to pipe the node --version output into cat, which can't accept plain strings. So, I won’t pipe to cat here.
**Running Supabase commands**

I should run the command with npx supabase while considering the possibility of it prompting for login. The user mentioned to “just put npx,” so I’ll follow that. We can include the --project-ref and consider using --db-url since Supabase CLI needs linking for commands like db pull. If the SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable isn’t set, it may prompt for a login, but I can attempt to use the token variable if it's provided later. Maybe the project's already linked, which could simplify things.
**Attempting Supabase commands**

I’m considering if I can run "npx supabase migration list" without login, but it probably won’t work. I’ll start by checking the version with "npx --yes supabase --version." For linking, I’ll need to ensure I use the correct token login approach, since it doesn't support PAT via a flag. If the SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable is present, I’ll proceed with login; otherwise, I’ll need to prompt for the PAT. Lastly, I’ll execute a series of Supabase commands as planned.
**Improving command execution**

Including "cd" should be fine since the maximize tool calls rule allows for batch commands. I can chain these commands in PowerShell using semicolons. First, I'll compose a single run_terminal_cmd. I need to ensure proper syntax for variable assignments and splitting.

Previously, I had a method that could return $null if no file was found, resulting in an error. So, I'll rewrite it to check for a valid file before proceeding with the migration repair. I’ll make sure to run the commands directly without piping to cat. Let's put this into action!
**Setting up Supabase commands**

I need to run several Supabase commands in a single run_terminal_cmd. First, I’ll check the version, then if the token variable is set, I’ll log in using that token, which is non-interactive. Next, I'll link the project and check the migration list. Then, I’ll pull the database and determine the file for repair before resetting the database without confirmation. The linking process may still prompt for additional input, like region selection, but I’ll attempt it first. I’ll add a brief status update before executing the commands. Let’s get started!</details></think>
