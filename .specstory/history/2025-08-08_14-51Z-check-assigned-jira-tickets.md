Yes! I found one Jira ticket assigned to you:

## **MVP-13: Rename profiles table to user_profiles for better naming convention**

**Details:**
- **Status:** To Do
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Issue Type:** Story
- **Created:** August 8, 2025 at 10:52 AM

**Summary:**
Rename the existing profiles table to user_profiles to follow more descriptive naming conventions and improve code clarity. The current table name "profiles" is too generic and could conflict with other profile-related entities in the application.

**Key Tasks:**
- Create database migration to rename profiles table to user_profiles
- Update existing migration file that adds name columns to reference new table name
- Update database trigger function handle_new_user() to reference user_profiles table
- Ensure all INSERT and UPDATE operations target the renamed table
- Verify that existing data remains intact during the rename operation
- Test that user signup process continues to work with new table name

You can view the full ticket here: [MVP-13](https://fanalyzr.atlassian.net/browse/MVP-13)

This appears to be the same ticket that was mentioned in the documentation you attached. Would you like me to help you get started on implementing this database migration?
